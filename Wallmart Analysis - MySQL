Project Description: Walmart Sales Data Analysis


Objective:
The project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's sales data by leveraging SQL queries.
The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights that can inform strategic business decisions. 
Key areas of focus include product performance, customer behavior, revenue trends, 
and the impact of different timeframes on sales.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Renamed misaligned column names (prodect_line to product_line and payement to payment_method) for consistency and clarity.
Added new columns such as time_of_day, day, and month to facilitate time-based analyses.
Feature Engineering:

Created a time_of_day column to categorize sales transactions into morning, afternoon, evening, and night segments.
Extracted day names and month names from transaction dates to analyze sales patterns over different days of the week and months of the year.
Classified product sales as "Good" or "Bad" based on average sales, providing a quick overview of product performance.


Business Questions and Analysis:

City and Branch Insights:
Identified unique cities where sales are made and associated them with specific branches.

Product Analysis:
Analyzed the number of unique product lines, identified the most selling product lines,
and determined which product line generates the highest revenue.
Revenue Analysis:
Evaluated total revenue by month and identified the month with the largest Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
Customer Behavior:
Analyzed customer types to determine which type contributes the most revenue and
which type is most common.

Sales Timing:
Investigated sales distribution across different times of the day and days of the week, 
identifying peak sales periods.

Advanced Insights:
Determined the branch with sales exceeding the average, 
analyzed the most common product line by gender, 
and evaluated average ratings per product line.
Assessed the impact of VAT and other taxes on sales, and identified the city with the largest tax percentage.

Outcome:
This project provides a robust analysis framework for Walmartâ€™s sales data, 
enabling detailed insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. 
These insights can be instrumental in guiding data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies 
and improve overall business performance.
